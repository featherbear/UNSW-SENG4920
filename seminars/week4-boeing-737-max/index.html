In terms of informed consent, Boeing did not make clear that the new 737 MAX was a different aircraft to previous aircrafts which resulted in unqualified pilots.</p></li></ul><h1 id=what-ethical-concerns-are-there-in-the-relationship-between-boeing-and-the-faa-what-could-have-been-done-differently>What ethical concerns are there in the relationship between Boeing and the FAA?

FAA did not believe that the consequences of self-certification were unethical as Boeing had a good track record of ethical behaviour - hindsight bias.</li><li>Duty-based: FAA didn't perform their duty of checking the planes and just relied on the self-certification from Boeing.</li><li>FAA should have required oversight of the self-certification process. FAA should have upheld their ethical guidelines to provide safe aircraft by verifying Boeing's results.</li><li>Boeing should have encouraged an atmosphere of cooperation by allowing engineers to safely report behaviour that they believed was against the code of conduct such as an improper review process.</li></ul><h1 id=did-competition-between-boeing-and-airbus-lead-to-the-circumvention-of-ethical-norms--is-competition-inherently-unethical>Did competition between Boeing and Airbus lead to the circumvention of ethical norms ?
